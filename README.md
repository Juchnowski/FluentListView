# ObjectListView
FluentListView is a C# wrapper around a .NET ListView, supporting model-bound lists, in-place item editing, drag and drop, icons, themes, trees & data grids, and much more. A fork of ObjectListView with a focus on performance.

All credits go to Phillip Piper for creating the original project [ObjectListView](http://objectlistview.sourceforge.net/).
